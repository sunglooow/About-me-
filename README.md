# About-me-

Whenever I'm on Ponytown I tend to just chill and go offtab to work on personal art or projects that I have going on at the moment! So if you have something you would like to ask or tell me it may do well to whisper it to me as that will help me see it easier!

I'm okay with talking to other people but sometimes get a bit nervous/don't know what to say so I'm sorry if my responses come off as dry or anything. Trying my best! I'm also perfectly okay with people sitting next to me, would really like that honestly it looks fun to be in a group with people :]
I like to whisper compliments to people but sometimes I forget if I have said a compliment to a certain person before, so I'm sorry if I have complimented you twice and seemingly forgotten that I did it the first time my memory is absolutely horrendous </3

If we're friends in PT you are free to come up to me whenever! Just know that I am a bit anxious with approaching people first, so I rely on the other person to do it for me. Please do not take it personally if I am online near you and I do not come and say hi, I just do not want to bother anyone!

In general just trying to have fun and relax, hope you all get to do the same!
